 HSIE Research is also available on Bloomberg ERH HDF GO  Thomson Reuters 03 February 2026 HSIE Results Daily HSIE Results Daily Contents Results Reviews  Hyundai Motor India: Hyundai Motor Indias (HMI) EBITDA margin at 11.2% missed our estimate by 126bps and Bloomberg consensus estimate by 152bps, mainly due to adverse gross margins and higher costs related to the new plant. Management has called out for higher costs related to the new plant, like labor, manufacturing overheads and depreciation, to sustain over the next 3-4 quarters. While we are positive on the PV industry over the medium term, led by the GST rate rationalization and exports potential, we remain concerned on the companys lack of aggression in the Indian market with regards to volumes and market share, where competition is getting more aggressive. We value the company at 25x Dec-27 EPS for a target price of INR 2,282, and maintain a REDUCE rating.  Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Company: CIFC reported a mixed set of results with an uptick in business momentum and NIM reflation, offset by elevated credit costs. Business momentum witnessed a healthy uptick, with disbursements growth of 16% YoY and 23% QoQ and is likely to pick up further in Q4, on the back of GST rate cut and an improving macro environment. However, credit costs remained elevated (1.8%) across segments and remains a key monitorable in the near term. However, management has indicated improving collections and recoveries, reflecting in marginal improvement in early delinquencies. While CIFC remains a robust franchise with a RoE of 19-20% and AUM growth of 20-22%, current valuations (3.8x Sep-27 ABVPS) provide limited margin of safety. We revise our FY26FY27EFY28E earnings estimates due to higher credit costs, partly offset by marginal NIM reflation and maintain ADD with a revised RI-based TP of INR 1,730 (implying 4.1x Sep-27 ABVPS).  Gail (India): Our BUY recommendation for GAIL with a target price of INR 196 is based on its ability to defend gas marketing margin despite increased gas cost pressure and recovery in gas transmission volume. Q3FY26 reported standalone EBITDA at INR 26.5bn (-6.4% YoY, -16.8% QoQ) and APAT at INR 16bn (-17.4% YoY, -27.7% QoQ), below our estimates, due to lower-than- expected profitability posted by the petchem segment as increased gas cost weighed on earnings.  PB Fintech: PBFINTECH core operating revenue grew by 37% YoY, led by sustained traction in the Policybazaar business (39% YoY), partly offset by weakness in the Paisabazaar business (23% YoY). PAT grew nearly 2.6x YoY, supported by a 771bps improvement in cost-to-income ratio to 93.5% (Q3FY25: 101%). While overall revenue was slightly ahead of our estimates, on account of lower-than-expected yield compression and strong premium channelization, the bottom line missed estimates on account of higher operating expenses. Policybazaar, the companys flagship platform, offers insurers a data-rich, efficient channel with measurable outcomes, which has singularly reshaped Indias insurance distribution landscape by solving critical industry-wide challenges (high CACs and poor lead conversion). The platforms evolution into a data-driven, profit-sharing partner further reinforces its right-to-win in the digital insurance space. Regulatory headwinds from Bima Sugam and overhang on revamp of distributor payout structure notwithstanding, PBFINTECH is positioned as the undisputed platform of choice, given its strong growth runway and a sustainable right- HSIE Research Team hdfcsec-researchhdfcsec.com Page  2 HSIE Results Daily to-win. We maintain BUY with a revised DCF-based TP of INR2,180 (implying 57.3x FY28 EPS and a PEG ratio of 0.8x).  Steel Authority of India: We maintain ADD on Steel Authority of India (SAIL), with an unchanged target price of INR 150share (5.5x FY28E standalone EBITDA). In Q3FY26, SAILs totalown sales volume firmed up 165% YoY. Weak pricing mainly for flats pulled down EBITDA margin by INR 0.7kMT QoQ to INR 4.5kMT. Margin also contracted INR 90MT YoY on weak pricing. We expect SAIL to deliver 7% total volumeEBITDA CAGRs of 712% respectively during FY25-28E, aided by healthy steel price recovery and production ramp-up.  Sundaram Finance: Sundaram Finance (SUF) reported a steady operating performance, with healthy NII growth and uptick in loan growth (16% YoY). SUF sustained the uptick in business momentum with disbursements growth of 14% YoY, driven by core MHCV, cars and tractors segments. While asset quality improved marginally sequentially, management indicated continued cash flow challenges across segments, especially MSMEs driving higher credit costs. As highlighted in our company update, SUF remains a pristine franchise with steady cross-cycle profitability and loan growth. We revise our FY26FY27EFY28E earnings estimates to reflect higher loan growth, offset by higher credit costs, and maintain ADD with a revised SoTP-based TP of INR4965 (standalone entity at 3.6x Sep-27 ABVPS).  Aster DM Healthcare: EBITDA grew 12% YoY, led by 13% growth in the hospital business, as lower occupancy at 61% (vs 63% in Q3FY25) was offset by an 15% YoY increase in ARPOB. Hospital EBITDA rose 12% YoY, with margin decreasing by 50bps to 21.5% due to INR 130 mn drag from new hospital (at Kasargod). ASTERDM expects: (1) steady growth in hospital business with strong performance in Kerala cluster and scale-up in other clusters (2) bed capacity expansion to have some delays. While the bed addition is well spread over FY26-28, the EBITDA drag from new hospitals keep margin under pressure (3) Quality Care Hospital (QCIL) to see steady growth along with bed capacity expansion (1,700 beds with capex outlay of INR 20 bn). The QCIL merger is on track though, with a completion timeline by Q1FY27. Factoring in Q3 miss, lower margin, and delay in capacity addition (Ramesh Ongole: 75 beds Whitefield: 159 beds in late Q4FY26 WC, Hyderabad: 300 beds in H2FY27 from H1, Sarjapur Phase I: 300 beds in FY28 from H2FY27), we have cut our FY2627E EBITDA estimates by 96% and revised our TP to INR 640 (25x Q3FY28E blended EVE). ADD stays.  LIC Housing Finance: LIC Housing Finances (LICHF) Q3FY26 earnings were marginally ahead of our estimates due to higher other income and steady margins. Loan growth remained subdued (5% YoY), driven by muted disbursements growth (4% YoY). LICHF continues to prioritize margins over loan growth, with marginal reflation in NIMs at 2.66%, driven by lower cost of funds and no reduction in benchmark lending rate. LICHFs subdued loan growth (11% CAGR during FY15-FY25) amidst elevated competitive intensity in the core home loans segment remains a key monitorable. However, the current subdued valuations (0.6x Sep-27 ABVPS) provide a favorable risk- reward with slight deterioration in profitability during FY26-FY28E. We revise our FY26E-FY28E earnings estimates to factor in lower loan growth and marginally higher NIMs and maintain ADD with a revised RI-based TP of INR 660 (implying 0.8x Sep-27 ABVPS).  CDSL: CDSL reported a muted quarter, with revenue down 4.6% QoQ (below estimate) and PAT at INR 1.33bn (vs est. INR 1.48bn). The decline was driven by a sharp fall in e-voting and IPO revenue, while annual issuer revenue also softened. Regulatory changes in the definition of not so small unlisted Page  3 HSIE Results Daily companies (effective Dec25) are expected to weigh on unlisted additions, with the full impact visible in Q4. EBITDA margin contracted 279485bps QoQYoY to 52.9%, impacted by higher tech spends in line with regulatory requirements. IPOcorporate action revenue slowed in Q3 and is likely to decline further in Q4. Demat account additions rose to 7.6mn (vs 6.5mn), with CDSL maintaining its leadership position at 80% market share and 85% in incremental accounts. Growth continues to be supported by strong issuer revenue, recovery in transactions, and stable e-voting, e-CAS and KYC revenue. The company plans to continue investing in technology and talent to sustain its competitive edge and adhere to regulatory compliance. We cut our revenue estimates by 3-4% for FY2628E, factoring slower growth in market-linked streams, and lower EPS estimates by 6-7% due to higher technology investments. Revenue and EPS are expected to clock CAGRs of 15% and 12% over FY2528E, respectively. We maintain ADD with a TP of INR 1,520, valuing the stock at 45x Dec26E EPS CDSL trades at 43x35x FY2728E EPS.  The New India Assurance Company: NIACL printed NEP growth at 10%, in line with of our estimates, as PAT missed our estimates, owing to continued provision for wage revisions and higher motor loss ratios. NIACL maintained its GI leadership position with a share of 13.4% (9MFY25: 12.8% FY25: 12.6%), primarily led by group health segment (17% YoY). NIACL continued to recalibrate its motor portfolio, which was largely skewed toward the commercial vehicle segment. We believe PSU insurers seldom exercise the right of refusal, resulting in inferior outcomes in terms of profitability. During 9MFY26, NIACL also provided for the arrears of wage revision amounting to INR25bn and have offset this impact with higher investment gains to the tune of INR20bn specifically to neutralize this. After a strong improvement in profitability in FY25, CoR has continued to disappoint due to motor segments consistently higher loss ratio and one-off impact from wage arrears, and large catastrophic losses we expect CoR to remain elevated for FY26E. Our forecasts imply 922% NEPPAT CAGR over FY25-28E, driven by improvement in underwriting performance and moderation in the float income from the investment book (AUM INR0.9trn). We maintain an ADD with a revised TP of INR175 (0.7x Sep-27 BV).  Ather Energy: While the current volume inflection is led by dealership expansion, the next inflection from FY27FY28 is likely to be driven by portfolio expansion via its upcoming low cost EL platform, which will also add more affordable models to the portfolio, thereby bringing in a new set of customers and expanding the addressable market. Going forward, we expect the cost structure to persistently improve over the medium term, aided by economies of scale, operating leverage, introduction of the low-cost EL platform, improving non-vehicle revenue mix, and continued value engineering efforts. It continues to impress with its capability to scale volumes and increase market share along with margin improvement (that too without PLI). We value the company at 6.0x EVsales for a TP of INR897 maintain BUY. It continues to be our top pick.  City Union Bank: City Union Banks (CUBK) Q3FY26 earnings were in line with estimates. There was strong growth on both sides of the balance sheet and significant margin reflation was offset by a higher provisioning buffer. Strong loan growth (21% YoY) was led by the gold and MSME segments while the retail book continued to scale rapidly. Deposit growth (21% YoY) hugged loan growth, with CASA ratio declining to 27.3% (-84bps QoQ). Margins improved significantly to 3.9% (26bps QoQ), benefitting from lower cost of funds and yield improvement (despite rate cut impact). Management continues to shore up its provisioning buffer with surplus gains. We believe Page  4 HSIE Results Daily CUBK is likely to maintain its growth trajectory, with sustained traction in the MSME book and a notable expansion in secured retail portfolios, while maintaining a healthy asset quality. We tweak our FY26EFY27EFY28E estimates by -3%3%2%, factoring in stronger growth, better margins, partly offset by higher provisioning. We maintain BUY with a revised TP of INR295 (1.7x Sep-27 ABVPS).  Brigade Enterprises: Brigade Enterprises (BEL) sales volume was 1.3msf (- 39.1%-30.0% YoYQoQ), valued at INR 17.5bn (-29.8%-14.0% YoYQoQ), with average realization of INR 13,157psf (15.6%22.9% YoYQoQ). BEL has launched a pipeline of 12msf residential and 4.2msf commercial spaces in FY27, backed by a recent INR 21bn land acquisition and INR 160bn of new GDV addition. BEL is also seeing steady office leasing traction and healthy demand across segments despite macro concerns. Regulatory headwinds have posed a significant challenge to near-term momentum, with project approval delays linked to municipal transitions directly impacting sales growth and forcing key launch postponements into Q4FY26 (INR 55bn) and early FY27. Amidst these operational hurdles, a notable market shift has emerged, with consumers demonstrating heightened sensitivity to rising property prices, indicating a more value-conscious demand environment. Margin pressures from project mix, marketing expenses, and conservative ground rent accounting are expected to be temporary. To support expansion, including a Hyderabad officemall and a hotel portfolio targeting 1,700 keys, capex is projected at INR 6bn8bn for FY26FY27 resp. Moreover, the recognition of premium projects is anticipated to drive a margin improvement to 20% in early FY27. We reiterate BUY, with a reduced TP of INR 1,163sh to account for (1) inclusion of new projects in Hyderabad, Bengaluru, and Chennai (2) expansion in the officehospitality segment and (3) lowering of presales sales growth from 25% to 10% and NAV premium from 30% to 10%. BEL needs to look for newer markets to drive growth as geographic and premium mix changes have reduced velocity.  Medplus Health Services: EBITDA grew 25% YoY, led by 16% sales growth (pharmacy 16% YoY, diagnostics 19% YoY) and an expanded gross margin (113 bps YoY private label share to 22.2%), which offset higher costs. OPM came in at 5.4% (24 bps YoY), with pharmacy margin at 5.2% (13 bps YoY) and diagnostic margin at 15.5%. Medplus retains its guidance to add 600 stores in FY26E (400 added in 9M) and FY27E. It expects (1) overall private label sales continue to improve (gradual for pharma and faster for non- pharma) over the next few quarters (on GMV every 1% increase, implying 0.5% on net sales), given stickiness in the business (90% repeat purchase due to favourable discounts), aiding steady GM expansion (2) pick-up in growth from mature stores largely led by low base, better product availability (operationalization of new warehouses) and change in incentive structure (focus on both branded and private label) and (3) margins to remain steady with increase in private label share, which may be offset by new store additions. We see a pick-up in sales growth, led by a balanced approach to mature store growth, new store additions, and private label expansion. Moreover, margins are expected to see gradual improvement, led by a better mix, steady growth in matured stores (2 years 1011% margin), increased private label share, and supply chain efficiencies. Factoring in Q3, we have raised EBITDA for FY2627E by 3% and revised TP to INR 1,060 (17x Q3FY28E EVEBITDA, implying 26x pre-INDAS EVEBITDA). BUY stays.  Mahindra Lifespaces: Mahindra Lifespaces Developers Ltd (MLDL) reported revenueEBIDTA APAT at INR 4.5bn298mn831mn. MLDL aims to deliver 25-30% CAGR in presales over FY25FY30, targeting INR 4550bn in presales by FY27, supported by timely launch approvals and execution discipline. Page  5 HSIE Results Daily During the quarter, business development worth INR 10bn took place, taking the 9MFY26 BD to INR 105bn. Mahindra Blossom in Bengaluru was the standout launch, generating over INR 10bn in its opening weekend, which would reflect in Q4FY26 presales. The forthcoming launches for Marina 64 (Plot A), Bhandup, and Mahalaxmi have been slightly delayed due to new EC requirements, a one-time regulatory hurdle, all lined up for Q4FY26. Over the past 21 months, MLDL has secured BD worth over INR 290bn, enhancing new launch visibility and laying a solid foundation for its ambitious growth plans. This is a huge growth step up and sets the tone for achieving an FY29 presales target of INR 80-100bn. The strategy is clear a disciplined focus on core markets (MMR, Pune, and Bengaluru), fast project turnaround times, and stringent financial hurdles (20% IRR). This expanding pipeline, combined with a rights-issue-strengthened balance sheet (INR 15bn raised) positions MLDL to achieve this target in the coming years. Additionally, the ICIC business is expected to generate INR 15bn PAT over the next 10 years, offering an additional lever for long-term profitability and cash flows. Given the strong cash flows, robust launches, stable balance sheet, and likely growth through rights, we remain constructive with a BUY on MLDL and a TP of INR 700sh.  Ashoka Buildcon: Ashoka Buildcons (ASBL) standalone revenueEBITDAAPAT came in at INR 14.61.30.4bn, a miss of 15.827.749.4% vs. our estimates on account of muted execution. ASBL has guided for -10%15% revenue growth YoY (earlier 10% for FY26) in FY2627, while EBITDA margin guidance stands at 9% (earlier 10%). The OB as of Dec-25 stood at INR 159bn (2.26x FY25 revenue). Further, ASBL guided for OI of INR 30bn for Q4FY26 (FY27: INR 110-120bn), with a bid pipeline of INR 800bn (80% NHAI). Business-wise, the revenue is well-diversified with HAM (roads)EPC (roads)power TDrailways and others comprising 13.251.921.994% respectively. Additionally, ASBL has already invested INR 6.1bn in the current HAM portfolio the balance equity requirement in its existing NHAI HAM assets is INR 3.2bn as of Dec-25 (to be invested by FY28). Given the stable OB, improving visibility on asset monetization inflows (assets sale conclusion by Jun-26) and improved balance sheet on the back of deleveraging through HAM monetization, we maintain BUY with a reduced TP of INR 233sh (11x Dec-27E EPS). We have cut estimates to factor in the ordering delay and margins. Page  6 HSIE Results Daily Hyundai Motor India New plant costs to cap margin expansion Hyundai Motor Indias (HMI) EBITDA margin at 11.2% missed our estimate by 126bps and Bloomberg consensus estimate by 152bps, mainly due to adverse gross margins and higher costs related to the new plant. Management has called out for higher costs related to the new plant, like labor, manufacturing overheads and depreciation, to sustain over the next 3-4 quarters. While we are positive on the PV industry over the medium term, led by the GST rate rationalization and exports potential, we remain concerned on the companys lack of aggression in the Indian market with regards to volumes and market share, where competition is getting more aggressive. We value the company at 25x Dec-27 EPS for a target price of INR 2,282, and maintain a REDUCE rating.  Quarterly performance: Revenue at INR 179.7bn grew 8% YoY and 2.9% QoQ, 1.8% above our estimate and in line with Bloomberg consensus estimate. Realization remained flat QoQ, despite unfavorable product mix, as discounts eased from 3.2% in Q2 to 2.6% in Q3. Gross margin deteriorated 124bps QoQ on the back of a unfavorable product mix, commodity inflation, and plant startup costs.  Call takeaways: (1) Management indicated that based on a discussion within SIAM, broadly 6% YoY growth is expected for domestic passenger vehicles sales for FY27. (2) It highlighted ASP improved 5% YoY on the back of a strong mix and prudent pricing, while ASP was maintained on a QoQ basis despite seasonality and higher competition. (3) Discounts declined from 3.2% on ASP in Q2FY26 to 2.6% in Q3FY26. (4) It indicated that a total impact of about 100bps on account on new plant-related costs is expected to continue for a year, of which an impact of 60-70bps has been borne in Q3FY26. (5) Profitability was impacted on a YoY basis by the increase in processing cost linked with capacity expansion, while on a QoQ basis, it was due to unfavorable mix and marketing expenses. (6) The launch of new taxi-oriented range along with GST rate cut has been helping Aura sales volumes. (7) With a shift of all-new Venue to the Pune facility, the Pune plant has already achieved 90% capacity utilization. (8) Management indicated that the channel inventory is low, with inventory being 2-3 weeks as of 31 December 2025, which increased to four weeks by the end of January 2026 (normalized inventory in Jan is usually five weeks). (9) Commodity price inflation continues to put stress on margins, though it is working on mitigating this through long-term supplier sourcing strategy, cost optimization, localization, and value engineering. (10) The rural contribution to sales was more than 24% in Q3FY26, the highest-ever quarterly. (11) It maintained its guidance on 11- 14% EBITDA margin to continue for the coming years. (12) As a % of domestic sales volume, CNG is now at 16% and diesel at 21%.

Business momentum witnessed a healthy uptick, with disbursements growth of 16% YoY and 23% QoQ and is likely to pick up further in Q4, on the back of GST rate cut and an improving macro environment. However, credit costs remained elevated (1.8%) across segments and remains a key monitorable in the near term. However, management has indicated improving collections and recoveries, reflecting in marginal improvement in early delinquencies. While CIFC remains a robust franchise with a RoE of 19-20% and AUM growth of 20-22%, current valuations (3.8x Sep-27 ABVPS) provide limited margin of safety. We revise our FY26FY27EFY28E earnings estimates due to higher credit costs, partly offset by marginal NIM reflation and maintain ADD with a revised RI-based TP of INR 1,730 (implying 4.1x Sep-27 ABVPS).  NIM reflation drives strong PPoP growth: CIFCs NIMs (reported) improved by 10bps QoQ to 8%, driven by lower cost of funds (10bps QoQ). Management expects NIM reflation of 5-10bps, going ahead, driven by a benefit on cost of funds. Opex ratios remained steady (opex-to-AUM at 3.3%) and are likely to remain elevated in the near term, given the investments in gold loans business and increase in collections intensity.  Asset quality normalization key monitorable: GS-IIINS-III deteriorated QoQ to 3.4%2% (Q2FY26: 3.3%1.9%), with GS-II at 2.9% (Q2FY26: 3.1%), driving elevated credit costs of 1.8% (Q3FY25: 1.55%). Elevated credit costs were led by vehicle portfolio (2%), CSEL portfolio (6.4%), home loans (1.1%), and SBPL (2.7%). As per the management, credit costs are likely to improve, going ahead, with increasing capacity utilization in vehicle finance, recalibration of CSEL portfolio and collectionsrecoveries efforts in home loans and SBPL portfolio. However, credit costs are likely to remain higher compared to pre-pandemic levels, partly due to shifting portfolio mix.  Improving growth outlook limited margin of safety: CIFC reported a strong uptick in disbursements across most segments in Q3. With improving economic outlook, we expect a sustained uptick in disbursements to drive 20-22% AUM CAGR during FY26-FY28E. However, sticky credit costs (average of 1.4% for the last 10 quarters), along with demanding valuations (3.8x Sep-27 ABVPS), limit any meaningful margin of safety. Maintain ADD.

NG marketing: Q3 marketing volume stood at 103.98mmscmd (4.5% YoY, -1.4% QoQ), in line with our estimate and EBITDA came in at INR 11.1bn (74.6% YoY, - 28.8% QoQ).  Petchem: Q3 petchem EBITDA further reduced sequentially to a loss of INR 3.45bn (vs a loss of INR 1.45bn in the previous quarter) due to higher raw material cost (21.9% YoY, 10.2% QoQ). Polymer sales volume stood at 218kT (-1.4% YoY, 4.3% QoQ). Realization contracted sequentially to INR 92.7kg (-1.1% YoY, -3.2% QoQ).  NG transmission: GAIL reported volumes of 125.5mmscmd (-0.4% YoY, 1.5% QoQ) and transmission tariffs of INR 2,392tscm (-3.8% YoY, -0.6% QoQ), delivering EBITDA of INR 19.2bn (5.0% YoY, 7.9% QoQ) for the quarter. Sequential recovery in volume growth was led by improved demand from fertilizer, refinery, and CGD sectors.  Key takeaways: (1) Gas marketing  PBT guidance maintained at INR 40-45bn for FY26E. Management provided FY27 PBT guidance of INR 40bn for this segment. 16.5MMTPA of gas is currently sourced through long-term contracts, of which 6.55MMTPA is linked to the Henry Hub index and the balance to Brent. GAIL intends to increase the long-term contract portfolio to 22-23 MMTPA by FY30. For FY27, it expects marketing volumes to reach 110mmscmd. (2) Gas transmission  volume reached a high of 128.65mmscmd in December 2025, signifying improved demand. GAIL has retained its volume guidance for FY2627E of 124134mmscmd respectively. Split of expected incremental demand of 10mmscmd in FY27 is as follows  4231mmscmd from CGDpowerrefineryfertilizer segments. Revised transmission tariff of INR 65.69mmbtu (up from INR 58.61mmbtu), which has come into effect from 1 January, 2026, is expected to result in INR 12bn of incremental annual EBITDA. GAIL has filed a review petition seeking a further tariff increase of INR 15mmbtu. (3) Petchem  Higher raw material cost impacted this segments profitability. Gas cost increased to USD 11.21mmbtu in Q3FY26, up from USD 10.49 in Q2FY26 and USD 9.45mmbtu in Q3FY25. Management noted that polymer prices improved by  INR 3,500MT toward the end of the quarter. (5) GAIL incurred a capex of INR 21.86bn in Q3FY26. The company expects to incur a capex in the range of INR 90-100bn for FY27.  Valuation: We tweak our FY2627E EPS estimates by -6.7-12.3% respectively to factor in the weaker-than-expected performance of the petchem segment. We revise our SOTP target price to INR 196sh, based on 11x Mar-27E EVEBITDA for the natural gas, LPG transmission and domestic gas marketing business, 4x EVEBITDA for non- domestic gas marketing business, 6x EVe for petchem and LPG  LHC businesses, and INR 41 for investments. The stock is currently trading at 12.7x Mar-27E EPS and 9.4x EVEBITDA.

PAT grew nearly 2.6x YoY, supported by a 771bps improvement in cost-to-income ratio to 93.5% (Q3FY25: 101%). While overall revenue was slightly ahead of our estimates, on account of lower-than- expected yield compression and strong premium channelization, the bottom line missed estimates on account of higher operating expenses. Policybazaar, the companys flagship platform, offers insurers a data-rich, efficient channel with measurable outcomes, which has singularly reshaped Indias insurance distribution landscape by solving critical industry-wide challenges (high CACs and poor lead conversion). The platforms evolution into a data-driven, profit- sharing partner further reinforces its right-to-win in the digital insurance space. Regulatory headwinds from Bima Sugam and overhang on revamp of distributor payout structure notwithstanding, PBFINTECH is positioned as the undisputed platform of choice, given its strong growth runway and a sustainable right-to-win. We maintain BUY with a revised DCF-based TP of INR2,180 (implying 57.3x FY28 EPS and a PEG ratio of 0.8x).  Strong growth in the flagship business: Revenues marginally beat expectations due to tailwinds from GST rate cut and positive surprise on lower yield compression. Growth in new initiatives continues to be driven by the POSP channel, which is now being expanded with a more granular focus. Insurance yields for Q3FY26 declined to 17.7% (H1FY26: 18.4%) due to impact of GST on the distributor payout although compression was lower due to change in the business mix.  Non-linear profitability going ahead: We expect a 5.6x jump in net profit over FY25-FY28E, driven by net revenue CAGR of 32% and doubling of trail- based commission income in the Policybazaar business. We are building a 100bps decline in insurance commission yields for FY27E due to GST rate cut (FY26E yield at 17.5%).  Regulatory overhang on distribution commission overhaul: Uncertainty around further rationalization of distribution commission would be a key risk. We believe the current EOM offers flexibility to insurers and hence is unlikely to significantly change the payout structure to distributors. We believe PBFINTECH offers the best economics of the insurance distribution business and is likely to navigate through efficiently in this scenario as well.

In Q3FY26, SAILs totalown sales volume firmed up 165% YoY. Weak pricing mainly for flats pulled down EBITDA margin by INR 0.7kMT QoQ to INR 4.5kMT. Margin also contracted INR 90MT YoY on weak pricing. We expect SAIL to deliver 7% total volumeEBITDA CAGRs of 712% respectively during FY25- 28E, aided by healthy steel price recovery and production ramp-up.  Q3FY26 performance: SAILs volume rose 516% QoQYoY to 5.15mn MT. Adjusted for the 0.37mn MT traded sales from NMDC Steel, own sales volume rose 74% YoYQoQ. NSR declined INR 1.2kMT QoQ, mainly on fall in flats realization. Scrapbyproduct sales accounted for INR 245MT in revenues vs INR 230MT QoQ. Unit EBITDA fell INR 680MT QoQ to INR 4.5kMT, as the impact of lower realization got moderated by op-lev gains. SAIL spent INR 20.554.3bn in capex in Q39M FY26.  Con call KTAs and outlook: SAILs consolidated volume is estimated at 19.7mn MT including traded sales from NSL, implying a 10% total volume growth (LTL 5%). It also guided own sales of 21mn MT (12% growth) in FY27E. Steel prices have been firming up, aided by extension of safeguard duties. However, the gains are expected to be moderated, owing to soaring coking coal prices. Blended coking coal cost for SAIL is expected to rise by 6% QoQ (lower vs industry). The company is working on a 4.5mn MT capacity expansion at IISCO (West Bengal) as well as debottlenecking at its Durgapur, Rourkela, Bhillai and IISCO plants. It plans to spend INR 75- 100150bn to support ongoing expansions during FY2627E. It is aiming to increase crude steel capacity by 15mn MT by FY31E, which includes 3mn MT increase through debottlenecking by FY28. In the first phase (after FY28E), it will add 7mn MT across its IISCO, Bokaro, and Durgapur plants. In the second phase, it will expand capacities at Rourkela and Durgapur by 8mnMT (expected by FY31). It will also add a 1mn MT downstream TMT Mill in Durgapur (post-FY28E) to convert its semis. We have increased FY262728E EBITDA estimates by 452% respectively and increase cumulative capex outgo estimate for FY26-28E to INR 230bn from INR 215bn earlier. Thus, our target price remains unchanged at INR 150share.

SUF sustained the uptick in business momentum with disbursements growth of 14% YoY, driven by core MHCV, cars and tractors segments. While asset quality improved marginally sequentially, management indicated continued cash flow challenges across segments, especially MSMEs driving higher credit costs. As highlighted in our company update, SUF remains a pristine franchise with steady cross-cycle profitability and loan growth. We revise our FY26FY27EFY28E earnings estimates to reflect higher loan growth, offset by higher credit costs, and maintain ADD with a revised SoTP-based TP of INR4965 (standalone entity at 3.6x Sep-27 ABVPS).  Healthy momentum in disbursements marginal NIM reflation: SUFs loan growth improved to 16% YoY, with MHCVcarsCE growing at 15%18.4%16% YoY. Disbursements growth sequentially was mainly driven by MHCV, cars and CE, while the retail CV segment remained subdued. With the impact of GST rate cut, strong rural demand and focus on core geographies, we expect the growth momentum to sustain. NIMs reflated by 10bps QoQ with an uptick in asset yields.  Credit costs moderating asset quality yet to normalize: SUFs asset quality metrics is yet to witness meaningful improvement amidst challenging macro environment due to cash flow challenges across segments, as per management. GS-IIINS-III improved marginally to 1.9%1.1% (Q2FY26: 2%1.1%), with credit costs at 0.72% (annualized) vs. 52bps in FY25. While credit costs are expected to improve in Q4, product diversification beyond core MHCV segment is likely to keep them higher vs. historical levels.  Mixed subsidiaries performance entity priced to perfection: SHUFs disbursements moderated (3% YoY), although profitability remained steady (1.8% RoA). The AMC entitys AUM growth witnessed an uptick (13% YoY) while the general insurance entity continued to grapple with high COR (119%). SUF remains a robust franchise, delivering strong profitability (core RoE of 19% for FY25) and maintaining pristine asset quality (cross-cycle credit costs of 50bps), though the current valuation (4x Sep-27 ABVPS) leaves little margin of safety.

Factoring in Q3 miss, lower margin, and delay in capacity addition (Ramesh Ongole: 75 beds Whitefield: 159 beds in late Q4FY26 WC, Hyderabad: 300 beds in H2FY27 from H1, Sarjapur Phase I: 300 beds in FY28 from H2FY27), we have cut our FY2627E EBITDA estimates by 96% and revised our TP to INR 640 (25x Q3FY28E blended EVE). ADD stays.  Q3 highlights: Sales grew 13% YoY to INR 11.85 bn, led by 15% YoY growth in hospitals (occupancy at 61%, ARPOB growth of 15%). Higher GM at 77.4% (97 bps YoY) was offset by higher staff costs (14% YoY) and SGA (13%) led to an EBITDA of INR 2.1bn (12% YoY) and 17.8% margin (-20 bps). PAT was INR 807 mn (12% YoY). EBITDA: (1) Hospital: 12% YoY, margin at 21.5% (-50 bps) (2) Labspharmacy: EBITDA at INR 50mn, margin at 7.5%.  Operating metrics: ARPOB at INR 52,300 (15% YoY) and occupancy at 61% (63% in Q3FY25). IPOPD volumes up 411% YoY. ALOS steady at 3.1 days. Clusters: Kerala: ARPOB was up 17% YoY and occupancy at 65% Karnataka, Maharashtra: ARPOB was up 17% YoY and occupancy at 55% (3) AP, Telangana: ARPOB was up 11% YoY, and occupancy is at 55%.  QCIL: Sales at INR 11.81bn (17% YoY), EBITDA at INR 2.79 bn (32% YoY), and margins expanded by 267 bps YoY to 23.6%, supported by procurement synergies across QCIL entities, which led to INR 200mn of EBITDA improvement. The Kerala cluster grew 25% YoY and Hyderabad units grew 20% in Q3. Bangladesh (Evercare) grew 21% YoY in 9MFY26.  Key takeaways from con call: In Q3, Aster saw strong 41% growth in MVT sales, led by 64% YoY growth in Kerala. The CONGO mix increased by 240bps to 52% in Q3FY26. Kasargod hospital: sales of INR 100mn and EBITDA drag of INR 130mn it expects to break even in a couple of quarters.

Loan growth remained subdued (5% YoY), driven by muted disbursements growth (4% YoY). LICHF continues to prioritize margins over loan growth, with marginal reflation in NIMs at 2.66%, driven by lower cost of funds and no reduction in benchmark lending rate. LICHFs subdued loan growth (11% CAGR during FY15-FY25) amidst elevated competitive intensity in the core home loans segment remains a key monitorable. However, the current subdued valuations (0.6x Sep-27 ABVPS) provide a favorable risk-reward with slight deterioration in profitability during FY26-FY28E. We revise our FY26E-FY28E earnings estimates to factor in lower loan growth and marginally higher NIMs and maintain ADD with a revised RI-based TP of INR 660 (implying 0.8x Sep-27 ABVPS).  Steady NIMs, driven by cost of funds tailwinds and limited asset repricing: LICHF reported muted NII growth of 5% YoY, led by subdued loan growth (5.1% YoY). Cost of funds declined by 14bps QoQ with incremental cost of funds declining by 1.07% during 9MFY26. This has aided reflation in NIMs to 2.66% (Q2FY26: 2.62%) amidst a declining interest rate environment and elevated competitive intensity. LICHF has kept its benchmark lending rate unchanged to protect its margins, leading to higher BT-outs. However, it has a reduced lending rate of up to 7.15%, in line with peers, in order to drive loan growth. RoARoE remained steady at 1.8%14.5%.  Asset quality improves sequentially: GS-IIGS-III improved QoQ to 3.08%2.45% (Q2FY26: 3.38%2.51%), with steady collections and recoveries in the retail segment, while the resolutions in large corporate accounts remain protracted. We expect credit costs at 20bps during FY26E.  Subdued loan growth risk-reward favorable: With prioritization of margins, loan growth is likely to remain a challenge for LICHF, particularly in retail home loans. While the management is optimistic about uptick in loan growth going ahead, the elevated competitive intensity and moderate housing demand are likely to weigh on loan growth. However, current valuations (0.6x Sep-27 ABVPS) factor in all these headwinds, making the risk-reward favorable.

INR 1.48bn). The decline was driven by a sharp fall in e-voting and IPO revenue, while annual issuer revenue also softened. Regulatory changes in the definition of not so small unlisted companies (effective Dec25) are expected to weigh on unlisted additions, with the full impact visible in Q4. EBITDA margin contracted 279485bps QoQYoY to 52.9%, impacted by higher tech spends in line with regulatory requirements. IPOcorporate action revenue slowed in Q3 and is likely to decline further in Q4. Demat account additions rose to 7.6mn (vs 6.5mn), with CDSL maintaining its leadership position at 80% market share and 85% in incremental accounts. Growth continues to be supported by strong issuer revenue, recovery in transactions, and stable e-voting, e-CAS and KYC revenue. The company plans to continue investing in technology and talent to sustain its competitive edge and adhere to regulatory compliance. We cut our revenue estimates by 3-4% for FY2628E, factoring slower growth in market-linked streams, and lower EPS estimates by 6-7% due to higher technology investments. Revenue and EPS are expected to clock CAGRs of 15% and 12% over FY2528E, respectively. We maintain ADD with a TP of INR 1,520, valuing the stock at 45x Dec26E EPS CDSL trades at 43x35x FY2728E EPS.  Q3FY26 highlights: CDSL revenue was down 4.6% QoQ but up 9.4% YoY. Total revenue of INR 3.04bn was lower vs our estimate of INR 3.27bn, led by 36.74.81.7% QoQ decline in OthersIPOAnnual Issuers revenue. This impact was partly offset by online data charges and transaction charges, which increased 6.51.7% QoQ. On the cost side, employee cost and other opex decreased by 2.62.4% QoQ while technology expenses increased by 12.343.2% QoQYoY. CDSLs EBITDA margin contracted by 279485bps QoQYoY to 52.9% because of the increased tech spending and fall in revenue. Other income stood at INR 0.29bn, up 30.1% QoQ, ETR stood at 22.5% vs 23.2% in Q2FY26 and APAT stood INR 1.33bn, down 4.9% QoQ.  Outlook: We expect revenue growth of 102017% and an EBITDA margin of 52.753.355.6 for FY262728E.

NIACL maintained its GI leadership position with a share of 13.4% (9MFY25: 12.8% FY25: 12.6%), primarily led by group health segment (17% YoY). NIACL continued to recalibrate its motor portfolio, which was largely skewed toward the commercial vehicle segment. We believe PSU insurers seldom exercise the right of refusal, resulting in inferior outcomes in terms of profitability. During 9MFY26, NIACL also provided for the arrears of wage revision amounting to INR25bn and have offset this impact with higher investment gains to the tune of INR20bn specifically to neutralize this. After a strong improvement in profitability in FY25, CoR has continued to disappoint due to motor segments consistently higher loss ratio and one-off impact from wage arrears, and large catastrophic losses we expect CoR to remain elevated for FY26E. Our forecasts imply 922% NEPPAT CAGR over FY25-28E, driven by improvement in underwriting performance and moderation in the float income from the investment book (AUM INR0.9trn). We maintain an ADD with a revised TP of INR175 (0.7x Sep-27 BV).  Investment income to the rescue: NIACLs investment book stood at INR0.9trn with equity allocation of 30% in FY25. Capital gains contributed 49% of the investment income in 9MFY26 (FY25:35%), higher than the corresponding contribution in larger private peers. The gains were significantly higher to offset the drag from the wage cost arrears (INR25bn). Further, the fair value change account has a balance of INR200bn in the form of unrealized gains, which we believe is likely to offer cushion for further provisioning of INR7-8bn due to revision in family pension (pending notification). Management guided for moderation in investment gains from next year onwards.  Improvement in motor business matrices key to sustained profitability: NIACL have lost market share (-85bps YoY) in motor segment, owing to recalibration of the overall motor portfolio. NIACL aims to improve motor business performance by adopting a geographically focused growth strategy, increasing exposure to private cars (9MFY26: 37% share) while reducing dependence on the loss-making commercial vehicle segment (9MFY26: 47% share in Motor TP segment). We believe these shifts are expected to take a hit on growth in near term though would support profitability in the coming years.

Going forward, we expect the cost structure to persistently improve over the medium term, aided by economies of scale, operating leverage, introduction of the low-cost EL platform, improving non-vehicle revenue mix, and continued value engineering efforts. It continues to impress with its capability to scale volumes and increase market share along with margin improvement (that too without PLI). We value the company at 6.0x EVsales for a TP of INR897 maintain BUY. It continues to be our top pick.  Quarterly performance: EBITDA margin at -7.6% improved by 1,461bps YoY and 719bps QoQ, a beat to our estimate of -14.0% (we estimated rising battery cell costs to hit gross margins) and Bloomberg consensus estimate of -10.4%. EBITDA margin improvement was driven by operating leverage and increase in non-vehicle revenue contribution. Gross margin came in at 21.9% improving 557bps YoY and 316bps QoQ. The quarter recorded non-vehicle revenue contribution at 14%, which is the highest ever mix.  Business expansion: The company has expanded its total store count by 76 stores over Q3FY26 to 600 stores. Management expects to continue the pace of store addition to reach 700 stores by the end of Q4FY26, with continued focus on Middle India: Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Odisha. As of 31 Dec 2025, charging network reached 5,000 points, which the company is now also able to monetize.  Path to profitability: Through continued efforts, management has been able to reduce the Bill of Material (BOM) cost from INR 120k in FY25 and to INR 110k as of 9MFY26, with total battery cell cost being below 20% of the BOM cost. This has also been possible due to the transition from NMC to LFP batteries for a large part of the portfolio. The upcoming EL platform is a low- cost architecture that also helps de-risk from volatile aluminum prices. It indicated that there is no risk from cannibalization of Rizta, as in case that happens, it would in fact aid profitability. It is also working to improve the mix of non-vehicle revenue, from the current 14%. It believes that there is a large runway considering higher potential of spares and service revenue as the fleet size expands and with higher monetization of the pro-pack, which is a key value proposition as well as a differentiator vis-à-vis peers.  Dodging headwinds: Management, via its value engineering and RD efforts, has structurally improved the cost structure so that it is better able to absorb the withdrawal of demand incentives and higher RM costs.

Margins improved significantly to 3.9% (26bps QoQ), benefitting from lower cost of funds and yield improvement (despite rate cut impact). Management continues to shore up its provisioning buffer with surplus gains. We believe CUBK is likely to maintain its growth trajectory, with sustained traction in the MSME book and a notable expansion in secured retail portfolios, while maintaining a healthy asset quality. We tweak our FY26EFY27EFY28E estimates by -3%3%2%, factoring in stronger growth, better margins, partly offset by higher provisioning. We maintain BUY with a revised TP of INR295 (1.7x Sep-27 ABVPS).  Strong growth momentum coupled with healthy margins: Loan growth was strong (21% YoY, 7% QoQ), with continued traction in core MSME and gold loans and scaling of the retail portfolio. We build in 19% loan CAGR over FY26-FY28E, led by MSME, gold loans, and secured retail book. NIMs improved to 3.9%, with improvement in yields (7bps QoQ), from better incremental pricing in gold and MSME segments, coupled with lower cost of funds (-15bps QoQ), from faster re-pricing of deposits.  Continue to shore up provisions: While gross slippages increased to 1.3% (Q2FY26: 1.1%), net slippages continued to be minimal (0.2%). CUBK as a prudent measure made higher standard provisions of INR2.2bn, while also increasing its PCR to 64.4% vs 63.2% as of Sep-25.  Sustained loan growth and strong margins to drive earnings: We believe that CUBK shall keep monetizing its investments in digital lending (MSME book) and secured retail segments (HL, Mirco LAP, and VL) to deliver better throughput and gain market share. Sustained growth in the core MSME segment, coupled with expansion of retail portfolios, is likely to drive improved return ratios.

BEL has launched a pipeline of 12msf residential and 4.2msf commercial spaces in FY27, backed by a recent INR 21bn land acquisition and INR 160bn of new GDV addition. BEL is also seeing steady office leasing traction and healthy demand across segments despite macro concerns. Regulatory headwinds have posed a significant challenge to near-term momentum, with project approval delays linked to municipal transitions directly impacting sales growth and forcing key launch postponements into Q4FY26 (INR 55bn) and early FY27. Amidst these operational hurdles, a notable market shift has emerged, with consumers demonstrating heightened sensitivity to rising property prices, indicating a more value-conscious demand environment. Margin pressures from project mix, marketing expenses, and conservative ground rent accounting are expected to be temporary. To support expansion, including a Hyderabad officemall and a hotel portfolio targeting 1,700 keys, capex is projected at INR 6bn8bn for FY26FY27 resp. Moreover, the recognition of premium projects is anticipated to drive a margin improvement to 20% in early FY27. We reiterate BUY, with a reduced TP of INR 1,163sh to account for (1) inclusion of new projects in Hyderabad, Bengaluru, and Chennai (2) expansion in the officehospitality segment and (3) lowering of presales sales growth from 25% to 10% and NAV premium from 30% to 10%. BEL needs to look for newer markets to drive growth as geographic and premium mix changes have reduced velocity.  Q3FY26 financial highlights: Revenue came in at INR 15.7bn (8%14.0% YoYQoQ, a miss by 1%) revenue from real estate at INR 11.3bn (19.1%7.5% YoYQoQ), hospitality at INR 1.6bn (20.1%15.6% YoYQoQ) and leasing at INR 3.3bn (-5.2%16.8%YoYQoQ).

Drag in presales was largely on the back of regulatory headwinds, with BEL now expected to miss 15% presales growth guidance revised lower to flat YoY.

OPM came in at 5.4% (24 bps YoY), with pharmacy margin at 5.2% (13 bps YoY) and diagnostic margin at 15.5%. Medplus retains its guidance to add 600 stores in FY26E (400 added in 9M) and FY27E. It expects (1) overall private label sales continue to improve (gradual for pharma and faster for non-pharma) over the next few quarters (on GMV every 1% increase, implying 0.5% on net sales), given stickiness in the business (90% repeat purchase due to favourable discounts), aiding steady GM expansion (2) pick-up in growth from mature stores largely led by low base, better product availability (operationalization of new warehouses) and change in incentive structure (focus on both branded and private label) and (3) margins to remain steady with increase in private label share, which may be offset by new store additions. We see a pick-up in sales growth, led by a balanced approach to mature store growth, new store additions, and private label expansion. Moreover, margins are expected to see gradual improvement, led by a better mix, steady growth in matured stores (2 years 1011% margin), increased private label share, and supply chain efficiencies. Factoring in Q3, we have raised EBITDA for FY2627E by 3% and revised TP to INR 1,060 (17x Q3FY28E EVEBITDA, implying 26x pre-INDAS EVEBITDA). BUY stays.  Q3 highlights: Sales grew 16% YoY to INR 18.06bn, with 16% growth in retail pharmacy (INR 17.71 bn) and 19% growth in diagnostics (INR 327mn). GM improved to 26.2% (113 bps YoY), which was offset by higher costs (staff SGA 1918%) led to EBITDA of INR 1.65 bn (25% YoY). Operating profit was INR 968mn (21% YoY) and OPM at 5.4% (24 bps). Pharmacy margin was 5.2% (13 bps), diagnostic margin 15.5%, and PAT INR 648mn (41%).  Q3 operating metrics: A net 182 stores were added (gross addition of 228), taking the total to 5,112, as of Dec25. Mature store growth was at 10.5% YoY (vs. 4.4% in Q3FY25), with operating margin at 12.4% (vs. 11%) and RoCE at 77.7% (vs. 61.7%). Private label sales as a percentage of total sales rose to 22.2% (vs. 19.6% in Q3FY25). Overall RoCE was 24.2% (up from 18.7%). In Q3FY26, OCF stood at INR 905mn while FCF was negative at INR 93mn.  Key takeaways from con call: Gross margin break-up: Private label pharma at 65-70%, private label non-pharma 25-30%, branded pharma at 13-14%, and branded non-pharma at 13-14%. Private label GMV share was at 18.9% (net at 11.6%). As of Dec-25, diagnostics had 180k active plans, covering 368k lives with a renewal rate of 23%. It has operationalized 60-70% of planned warehouses and manpower recruitment completed balance warehouses to be commissioned soon the company does not see a major increase in costs.

MLDL aims to deliver 25-30% CAGR in presales over FY25FY30, targeting INR 4550bn in presales by FY27, supported by timely launch approvals and execution discipline. During the quarter, business development worth INR 10bn took place, taking the 9MFY26 BD to INR 105bn. Mahindra Blossom in Bengaluru was the standout launch, generating over INR 10bn in its opening weekend, which would reflect in Q4FY26 presales. The forthcoming launches for Marina 64 (Plot A), Bhandup, and Mahalaxmi have been slightly delayed due to new EC requirements, a one- time regulatory hurdle, all lined up for Q4FY26. Over the past 21 months, MLDL has secured BD worth over INR 290bn, enhancing new launch visibility and laying a solid foundation for its ambitious growth plans. This is a huge growth step up and sets the tone for achieving an FY29 presales target of INR 80-100bn. The strategy is clear a disciplined focus on core markets (MMR, Pune, and Bengaluru), fast project turnaround times, and stringent financial hurdles (20% IRR). This expanding pipeline, combined with a rights-issue- strengthened balance sheet (INR 15bn raised) positions MLDL to achieve this target in the coming years. Additionally, the ICIC business is expected to generate INR 15bn PAT over the next 10 years, offering an additional lever for long-term profitability and cash flows. Given the strong cash flows, robust launches, stable balance sheet, and likely growth through rights, we remain constructive with a BUY on MLDL and a TP of INR 700sh.  Q3FY26 financial highlights: Revenue: INR 4.5bn (174.5%25x YoYQoQ, a beat by 190%). EBITDA came in at 298mn (INR 298-525mn in Q3FY25Q2FY26, vs est. loss of INR 154mn). Profit from JVassociates came in at INR 713mn (616-25.7% YoYQoQ). APAT stood at INR 831mn (-INR 225mn INR 479mn Q3FY25Q2FY26 vs est. profit of INR 507mn).  Ready for a launch-heavy year: MLDL recorded presales of INR 5.7bn (71%-23.9% YoYQoQ) and volume stood at 0.6msf (33.3%-31.8% YoYQoQ). Within ICIC, the company leased 17.9 acres for INR 1.3bn (191%34.4% YoYQoQ). We expect Q4FY26Q1FY27 to be record quarters, with presales of INR 2025bn.  Well-poised for growth in the year ahead: MLDL has several growth levers: 1. several projects are in final stages of design and approvals, primed for launch in FY26 2. it has increasing focus on mid-premium and premium segments, where its brand and execution capabilities offer differentiation and demand is strong.

ASBL has guided for -10%15% revenue growth YoY (earlier 10% for FY26) in FY2627, while EBITDA margin guidance stands at 9% (earlier 10%). The OB as of Dec-25 stood at INR 159bn (2.26x FY25 revenue). Further, ASBL guided for OI of INR 30bn for Q4FY26 (FY27: INR 110-120bn), with a bid pipeline of INR 800bn (80% NHAI). Business-wise, the revenue is well- diversified with HAM (roads)EPC (roads)power TDrailways and others comprising 13.251.921.994% respectively. Additionally, ASBL has already invested INR 6.1bn in the current HAM portfolio the balance equity requirement in its existing NHAI HAM assets is INR 3.2bn as of Dec-25 (to be invested by FY28). Given the stable OB, improving visibility on asset monetization inflows (assets sale conclusion by Jun-26) and improved balance sheet on the back of deleveraging through HAM monetization, we maintain BUY with a reduced TP of INR 233sh (11x Dec-27E EPS). We have cut estimates to factor in the ordering delay and margins.  Q3FY26 financial highlights: Revenue: INR 14.6bn (-18.415.6% YoYQoQ, a miss by 15.8%).

Robust order pipeline provides revenue visibility: ASBLs OI (incl. Adani (51%)  Ashoka (26%)  Aakshaya (23%) JV) in Q3FY26 stood at INR 25.7bn. Segment-wise, the OB is spread across road (EPC)road (HAM)Building EPCrailwayspower TD at 44.110.83.39.832.1%.
